# Jarvis

Jarvis is your admin assistant, putting Drupal at your fingertips via a quicksearch interface.

## Description

You may search nodes, taxonomy terms, and administrative links, preventing you from having to navigate the back-end of a site. This is particularly useful when trying to find content on a site that may contain thousands of nodes.

By using the Jarvis hotkey, "/" (forward slash) a search overlay will be prompted.  Start by entering your search terms. You can search for node titles or admin pages and Jarvis will begin to autocomplete.  You can use mouse up/down to view desired result and hit Enter or use your mouse to scroll.

## Installation

* Install just as any other module.
